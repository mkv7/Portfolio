# Moaeez — Portfolio (Static React via CDN)

A minimal, no-build portfolio site for **Moaeez Muhammad**. Uses React 18 from a CDN so you can host on **GitHub Pages** or any static host without Node tooling.

## Features

python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Customize
- Edit text in `main.js` (About, Education, Projects, Contact)
